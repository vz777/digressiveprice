# DigressivePrice

Easily create and manage range of quantities with associated prices.


## Installation

### Manually

* Copy the module into ```<thelia_root>/local/modules/``` directory and be sure that the name of the module is DigressivePrice.
* Activate it in your thelia administration panel

### Composer

Add it in your main thelia composer.json file

```
composer require thelia/digressiveprice-module:~1.0
```

## Usage

Once activated, go into the Modules tab of the product you want to add a digressive price to.
You can create a new range, edit or remove an existing one.
Fill the form with following information :

- Quantity
    - from : the quantity which begins your range
    - to : the quantity that ends you range.
- Price
    - default : the tax free price of the product when the quantity is in the defined range
    - promo : the tax free promo price of the product

Then click the "Add" or "Update" button.

Take care of the following :

- "quantity to" has to be greater than or equal to "quantity from"
- a quantity ('from' and/or 'to') can't be included into another range
- a range can't surround another one
- a quantity can't be negative

Once created, you have to integrate it to you front office thanks to the loop described later on.

The price will be automatically updated according to the product's quantity in the user's cart.

On the product page, the product price is updated according to selected quantity.
